BABY:
Check the "How to play" section
in the main menu "Retry"

You can do it!




EASY:
Check the "How to play" section
in the main menu "Retry"

Trying leads to failure
and failure leads to knowledge!
Keep going!

C'mon, you can do it!

You're learning, I'm proud of you

You almost did it this try!

Push harder than yesterday if you
want a different tomorrow!
- Said someone

If you fall again, I'll be here for you!
(said the floor)

If you keep following your dreams
like this, they might go file a
restraining order

Work when they sleep!
(also sleep when they work, if you're
on an international team like me ... welp)

I've got nothing more to say
But you're doing great!
Getting very close to beating it!





MEDIUM:
Can you really do it on medium? The frame time
scale gets sped up by 20% or something

[ if didn't complete in easy before ]
Maybe try the easy difficulty first
if you can't do it on hard...

Work hard, you will do it eventually
If you don't give up before it, that is

If you keep going, you will eventually
make it! ... Or will you?

C'mon you're not so bad, you almost made it
... probably


If you keep failing like this I might
sing a song to motivate you

Caaai a noite sobre o nosso amor...
e agora s√≥ restooou do amor...
uma palavra... adeus  (Portuguese)






HARD
Lol you can't do it on hard "I can"

Are you really going to still try it?
Give up "No!"

Birds are singing, flowers are blooming
On days like these, kids like you
Should be burning in hell "..."

Just so you know, the developer
managed to win this on second try "He good"

I'm kidding, it took me some more tries
But you will give up before that "I won't"
[OR]
Don't worry if you can't do it on hard
There's always babymode for you!

C'mon, this is getting tiresome, but
I'll count the times you failed
Just for fun, let's start: 6 "Spare me"

You failed to do it on hard seven times
Seven is my favorite number! "Don't care"

You failed to do it on hard eight times
Eight is the amount of bits in a byte! "nerd"

You failed to do it on hard nine times
That's the amount of planets in the solar system!
(Pluto is a planet!)

You failed to do it on hard ten times
That's the amount of hands in a finger
I didn't drink any alcohol today!

You failed to do it on hard eleven times
That's more than the amount
of fucks I give lol

You failed to do on hard twelve times
That's the amount of peanuts in a
pack of twelve peanuts!

Ok I'll just count from now on
Here we go: 13

You failed to do it on hard:
13 times
